    <main><strong>How can I prevent pregnancy?</strong>
    <p>Preventing pregnacy is really easy. You can not have any sexual intercourse at all! But if you mean during sexual intercourse, it is advised that you wear a condom at all times.</p>
      <strong>Can I get an STD from oral sex?</strong>  
        <p>Yes you can! There are diseases such as herpes, gonorrhea, hepatitis, syphillis, and HIV that can be transmitted via oral sex.</p>
        <strong>Should I really talk to my partner about their sexual history?</strong>
        <p>You should most definitely talk to your partner. Communicating with your partner will help establish boundaries for you both. It also helps you decide whether or not to get you or your partner tested. You will also realize the extent that your partner is willing to go. </p>
        <strong>Are condoms a total guarantee for no pregnancies?</strong>
        <p>Sadly, that is a no. It has been proven that rate of failure is at 3 percent. So, you still have a 97 percent chance of being safe. Just be smart about your decisions and actions!</p>
        <strong>Can I have more resources about safe sex?</strong>
        <p>Yes you can! In the <a href="resources.html">resources page</a> you can find some resources already provided. But I can throw some more into this for you.
